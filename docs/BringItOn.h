<h2>Bring It On<br>
<small>by smooved</small></h2>

System service, if you have any question in your mind as to whether I
can satisfy you, bring your requirements to me now.

smooved will satisfy you.

Bring it on to me, and I will do you like nobody can. I will publish
your services for you like nobody can. I will provide an auxilary
process in which to run these services like nobody can.

I am ready for you now.

Lay your requirements down, and I will show you what makes smooved the
only process you need.  I will call into your plug-in and obtain a top
level GHandler.  I will provide your GHandler with only the finest
BMessages from the farthest reaches of the system.  Then, I will allow
your handler to register itself as providing a particular type of
service.

We will be launched at boot time.  You and I.

All you have to do is tell me what to do and when to stop. And I
promise, you will not want it to stop until the power is cycled.  Bring
your services to me now, and I will show you an ease of integration
that you have never known.  I will provide your services at a level of
availability that no other daemon could ever do.

Damn.

Your plug-in will be loaded into only the most stable, persistent
environment.  If you have an application which needs backend services,
such as a smart card reader or automounter, I will work your backend
like it has never been worked.

I will also provide a settings module.

Aw, please, system service.  Bring your functionality to me, and I will
show you that my architecture is strong.  You will ride me all day and
all night and will never want to stop.

Baby, I want your plug-ins right now.  Give it up to smooved.

I am the daemon of your dreams and desires.  I will satisfy you, if
only you would allow me the pleasure.  I will swear on my honor as a
system server that I will do you right until the morning light.  I will
fulfill your every wish.  And I will use locking if necessary.

So, in conclusion, let me summarize by saying that I will load your
plug-in and work your backend, then I will feed you BMessages of every
kind and variety, and my architecture is strong.

Bring it on.
